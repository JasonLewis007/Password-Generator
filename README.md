# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
I was given partial code for a password generator.  I was asked to finish the code to program the password generator to generate a random password given the user choices of upper case letters, lower case numbers, numbers, and special characters.

After I completed the code:
Users will click the generate password button and be prompted to enetr number of characters between 8-128 characters.

Users will then be prompted if they would like to enter each type of character in.

Once all prompts are entered, a random password will be generated.

User will then click th generate password button again to generate a new password.
